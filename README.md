# Cat-vs-Dog-differentiator

The purpose of this phase of the project is to explore transfer learning with pre-trained models as a means of improving our object detection. In particular, our model will distinguish between cat and dog images and predict bounding boxes. Object detection has two main challenges. The first involves predicting the coordinates that connect the object of interest in the image. The second challenge is assigning the appropriate object category label. We use the PyTorch API to create a neural network for classification and linear regression separately. We then combine these two models by incorporating a combined loss function into our sequential model. In addition to the sequence model, we use object-oriented programming using the PyTorch API to create the CNN instead of the sequence model. We experiment with many different layers, optimizers, classifiers, etc. to improve our models. In addition, we use transfer learning through pre-trained models such as AlexNet to improve our detection scores and accuracy.
